## how to use it
- set up a bot (i assume you know how to do that)
- ``npm install`` to install packages
- open up nukebot.conf and enter values:
-   `token` is for the bot token
-   `message_to_send` is the message to spam
-   `channel_name` is the channel name to spam create
- lastly, run ``node index.js`` in a console, invite the bot to a server and write "nukeserver" in any of the channels and done.
